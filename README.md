# Reflection

In reflecting on my journey through CS 470, I can confidently say this course has played a significant role in helping me progress toward my professional goals. One of the most valuable skills I’ve learned is cloud computing, specifically working with AWS to develop and deploy a full stack web application. I’ve gained a deep understanding of cloud architecture, from building serverless APIs using AWS Lambda to managing databases like DynamoDB. These technical skills not only make me more competitive in the job market but also enable me to take on more advanced projects in cloud development.

I’ve also strengthened my problem-solving skills and my ability to think critically about system design. Throughout the course, I learned how to approach challenges in cloud migration, containerization, and orchestration, and this experience has helped me grow as a software developer. My strengths include my ability to break down complex problems, work effectively across the stack, and ensure scalable and maintainable solutions. With these skills, I’m prepared for roles such as cloud engineer, full stack developer, or DevOps engineer, where I can leverage my experience in building and managing cloud-based applications.

When it comes to planning for the future growth of my web application, I now have a solid understanding of how to scale efficiently using cloud services. Microservices and serverless architectures offer powerful ways to handle increased demand while maintaining flexibility. For instance, I would rely on serverless APIs for handling spikes in traffic, which automatically scale with demand, and containerization for managing more complex microservices that need to run consistently across different environments. Error handling would be addressed by incorporating redundancy and failover strategies using AWS services like S3 and CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting.

Predicting costs is essential when planning for growth. Serverless computing provides cost efficiency since it’s based on a pay-per-use model, which makes it easier to predict expenses as usage increases. However, for long-running tasks, containers may offer better cost predictability since they provide fixed resources. Both approaches have their pros and cons: serverless is great for dynamic scaling but can become expensive with high-frequency usage, while containers offer more control over resources but require more management.

Finally, elasticity and the pay-for-service model play critical roles in planning for growth. Elasticity ensures that the application can scale automatically with user demand, allowing me to focus on building features rather than worrying about infrastructure. The pay-for-service model helps balance performance with cost-efficiency, making it easier to expand the application without overspending on unused resources. These considerations will guide my decisions as I plan for future growth, ensuring the application can scale seamlessly while maintaining cost-effective operations.
